"""Tools for merging config file templates with local config files.

This is most useful for config files that mix persistent configuration (e.g.,
how the app should behave) with transient state (e.g., the window's last
geometry) or secrets (e.g., oauth tokens). The template contains all of the
persistent configuration, along with placeholders for everything else that
should end up in the resulting merged file.
